This directory contains some examples using Guile-WWW modules.

To use the modules before installing them, try ‘wily-guile’ in this directory
instead of plain old ‘guile’.  For some examples, it is enough to set and
export env var GUILE=$(pwd)/wily-guile.  For others, try something like:

 sed s,/usr/local/bin/guile,$(pwd)/wily-guile, PROGRAM > TMP
 mv TMP PROGRAM

This is not done automatically for you because the maintainer is lazy.
