Installation
============
(See file INSTALL for generic installation instructions.)

	Briefly, you need to issue these standard commands:

	  ./configure [options]
	  make
	  make install

	On "make install", these files are copied to these directories
	(creating them first if necessary), renaming each FOO.scm to
	simply FOO, and compressing them somewhat:

	  source/*            -- $(GUILE_SITE)/www (and subdirs)
	  doc/guile-www.info  -- $(prefix)/info

	Normally $(GUILE_SITE) is $(prefix)/share/guile/site
	     and $(prefix)     is /usr/local

	For guile to resolve these module names as (www FOO), make sure
	that $(GUILE_SITE) is in the ‘%load-path’.  To see the value of
	this variable use the command:

	  guile -c '(display %load-path)'

	For systems which have the "guile-tools make-module-catalog"
	program, "make install" also updates the module catalog in
	$(GUILE_SITE).
