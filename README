How to Build and Install Guile-WWW
==================================
(See file INSTALL for generic installation instructions.)

	Briefly, you need to issue these standard commands:

	  ./configure
	  make
	  make install

	On "make install", these files are copied to these directories
	(creating them first if necessary), renaming each FOO.scm to
	simply FOO, and compressing them somewhat:

	  *.scm               -- $(GUILE_SITE)/www
	  server-utils/*.scm  -- $(GUILE_SITE)/www/server-utils
	  data/*.scm          -- $(GUILE_SITE)/www/data
	  doc/*.info          -- $(prefix)/info

	Typically $(GUILE_SITE) is something like $(prefix)/share/guile/site
	      and $(prefix)     is something like /usr/local

	For guile to resolve these module names as (www FOO), make sure
	that $(GUILE_SITE) is in the `%load-path'.  To see the value of
	this variable use the command:

	  guile -c '(display %load-path)'

	For systems which have the "guile-tools make-module-catalog"
	program, "make install" also updates the module catalog in
	$(GUILE_SITE).
