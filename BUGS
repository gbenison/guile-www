bug 1 -- www:set-protocol-handler! dispatch not extensible
reported-by: offby1@blarg.net 2001-08-15
fixed: not-yet

offby1 sez:
;; BUG -- I don't really want this function to be public; I want
;; people to use `www:get' instead.  But if I use `define' here,
;; instead of `define-public', then when main.scm calls
;; www:set-protocol-handler!, https-via-lynx isn't defined.  This
;; means that I don't understand Guile's module system.

a protocol may have extra configuration data and methods, but these cannot be
expressed.  there are probably other instances of this restriction type in the
implementation, since it is not yet fully generalized.
		      
decision required: we can either add ad-hoc hooks; or upgrade entire API and
implementation, incorporating Evan Prodromou's (net http) module
  ( http://evan.prodromou.san-francisco.ca.us/software/net-http/ )
in the process, and use goops infrastructure.  this requires the user to use goops.
the middle way is to do both, but hide the goops implementation under a
functional hook interface (with placement more systematic than ad-hoc).

because the end point of any generalization requires virtualization (which is
what goops provides), but users are, generally, very specific; the middle way
results in the most work, but is likely the most useful work.  argh.  --ttn
