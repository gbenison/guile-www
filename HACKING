A Simple -*-outline-*- to HACKING Guile-WWW

* Guile 1.4.x

	Guile-WWW is primarily maintained using Guile 1.4.x, at:

	http://www.glug.org/people/ttn/software/guile/

	In particular, the autoconf macro GUILE_CHECK_ICE9_OPTARGS, used
	in acinclude.m4, can be found there (since 1.4.x takes pains to
	maintain both (ice-9 optargs-kw) and (ice-9 optargs)).

	If you don't want to install 1.4.x, you may be able to mine that
	macro out of Guile 1.4.x and/or tweak the aclocal invocation in
	autogen.sh to find it.
