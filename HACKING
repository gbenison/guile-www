This file is both a guide for newcomers and a todo list for oldstayers.
It lives in the repo but is not included in the distribution.

*** incorporate selected functionality from Guile 2 (web ...) modules
*** manual chapter "Server Utilities"
***** more on (www server-utils answer) facilities
***** templating strategies
***** sample servers
*** comment code (audience: intermediate scheme programmer)

* portability

  |     1.4.1.118 | yes       | yes   | yes |
  |     1.4.1.119 | yes       | yes   | yes |

*** everything UTF-8
*** ChangeLog
***** ttn-style: TITLE LF LF {BLURB LF LF}* BODY
***** exclude titles suffixed "; nfc." (no functional change)

* copyright update policy
*** individual files only on change
*** individual years
*** 2008+ to ttn

* repository branches
*** no ‘master’ -- do not panic!
*** a -- "anchor", "asis", "already", "argh-just-leave-me-alone"
    This branch is for what was already released.  It will never be rebased.
    Its tip will always have a commit title starting with "Release".
*** p -- "perhaps", "probably"
    This branch is where largely-stable changes intended for the next release
    live.  It's very unlikely to undergo rebase, but not entirely impossible.
    Guile-WWW hackers probably want to start here.
*** q/TOPIC -- "questionably", "querulously"
    These are experimental, exploring the particular TOPIC.  They are intended
    to be ephemeral, undergoing rebase, amendment, and ultimately removal.
